<!-- i18n-bar:end -->

A static recompilation of *Mario Kart World* (Nintendo Switch 2, versions 1.0.0 and 1.8.0) into a native PC program for Linux and
Windows. It needs your own copy of the game, dumped from your own console: nothing of the game is in this repository
or in its releases.

**It is a recompilation, not an emulator.** The game's AArch64 code is translated to C ahead of time and compiled
for the PC's CPU (x86-64, or AArch64 on Linux); there is no CPU interpreter or JIT. The GPU is not emulated either:
NVN2, the Switch 2 graphics API, is reimplemented on top of Vulkan at the API level, and the game's SM86 shaders are
translated to SPIR-V ahead of time. Nintendo SDK functions (`nn::*`) are replaced by name with our own code.

## Status

Early, and moving fast. On 12/11/2026:

- It boots, plays the intro movies, goes through the menus and races, on Linux and on Windows (x86-64), and on Linux
  on AArch64 (its own AppImage; tested on an Adreno 740 handheld).
- The start screen sets the game up from your copy on your machine (generates and compiles the C, translates the
  shaders, warms up the pipeline cache) and holds every setting: display, graphics quality, controls, hacks.
- Races run at 60 fps on high-end GPUs and at 30 on mid-range ones; see [Performance](#performance).
- Known problems: a few menus (mode, character and vehicle select) still need work, the kart's shadow misses a frame
  now and then, some audio cuts during movies, and on some AMD drivers the GPU can hang. There is no online play.

## Roadmap

The main open work, in order; the details are in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

- **60 fps in races.** Today a race frame is a serial chain: the game finishes its frame (~3 ms\*), then the Vulkan
  back end records the game's big submit (~19 ms\*), then the GPU runs it (~10 ms\*), and only then does the next frame
  start.
  Recording is on the critical path, so the work is recording with less CPU: dynamic state only when it changes, draw
  caches across frames, parallel recording, and a faster game thread.
- **The picture as on the console**: the last shader translator bugs, the kart's shadow, push constants, zero Vulkan
  validation errors.
- **Every menu checked** against the console: mode, character and vehicle select are next.
- **No GPU hangs** and less GPU memory, then loading without stutter and a Linux package for non-rolling distributions.
- **1.8.0 on par with 1.0.0**: its ultrawide aspect, shadow map size and fixed seed ([#19](https://github.com/adriadam10/mkw-recomp/issues/19)).

\* Measured on 09/11/2026 on our test machine: Radeon 660M APU (Ryzen 5 7535HS), Linux, 720p internal resolution.

## Performance

Measured frame times, each with its date, are in [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md). To add your machine,
open a [performance report](https://github.com/adriadam10/mkw-recomp/issues/new?template=performance.yml): it goes
into the table with the date of the report. The times are the game's own frames: frame generation shows more frames
but does not shorten them. 16.7 ms is 60 fps; Frame rate on Automatic (the console's) drops to 30 fps when 60 is out of
reach, and a frame over 33.3 ms runs the race slower than real time.

| Date | GPU | Internal resolution | Race fps | Race frame time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11/11/2026 | RX 7900 XTX (Windows) | 2160p | 60 | 16.7 ms |
| 11/11/2026 | RX 9070 XT (Linux, RADV) | 720p to 2160p | 60 | 16.7 ms |
| 10/11/2026 | RTX 3060 (Windows) | 1080p | ~48 | ~21 ms |
| 11/11/2026 | RTX 3050 Laptop (Windows) | 720p | ~37 | 26.7 ms |
| 09/11/2026 | Radeon 660M (Linux, RADV) | 720p | 30-32 | 31-33 ms |
| 11/11/2026 | GTX 1650 SUPER (Windows) | 1080p | ~24 | ~41 ms |
| 09/11/2026 | GTX 1050 Ti (Windows) | 1080p | 22-24 | 42-45 ms |

## Playing

![The start screen once the game is set up](docs/images/launcher-main.png)

![The Game files page, where the setup takes the player's dump](docs/images/launcher-files.png)

1. Dump Mario Kart World 1.0.0 or 1.8.0 from your Switch 2 (`exefs/` and `romfs/`, decrypted; 1.8.0 with the update
   merged into the base game's RomFS), or the same dump packed as one `.nup` or `.nx` file.
2. Download the launcher for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/adriadam10/mkw-recomp/releases): on Linux
   the `.AppImage` (`-aarch64` on ARM; the default game folder is `~/.local/share/mkw-recomp`; glibc 2.31 or newer: Debian 11,
   Ubuntu 20.04, SteamOS and later), on Windows the `.zip`, unpacked into a folder. Either needs about 30 GB free.
3. Run the AppImage (`chmod +x` first) or `mkw.exe`, open **Game files**, optionally use **Choose game folder** to select
   where the game will be installed (or an existing installation), then point it at your dump (**Choose folder** or
   **Choose .nup or .nx file**) and press **Set up**. The launcher remembers the installation folder; the compiled
   game, prepared files, saves, settings and caches live there. Selecting another folder keeps existing files in place.
   The first setup takes a while (it compiles the whole game and downloads NVIDIA's `nvdisasm` and `ptxas`, 84 MB on
   Linux and 126 MB on Windows, to describe the shader encoding on your machine); after that, **Play**.
4. When a newer release is out, the start screen offers it (**Update to vX**): it downloads it, checks it, replaces
   the program and sets up again only what changed. **Settings → Menu → Check for updates** turns the check off.

Requirements: x86-64 CPU with AVX2 (or, on Linux, AArch64 with ARMv8.2: LSE, FP16, RCpc, DotProd,
CRC32), a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 (`VK_EXT_mesh_shader` recommended; without it, task and mesh shaders run as compute),
16 GB of RAM recommended. In a Docker or Podman container on Linux, allow `userfaultfd` in its seccomp profile (Docker's
default refuses it): without it the port cannot tell which game memory changed, and runs several times slower.

## Extra features

Beyond the console, all optional and off (or at the console's value) by default:

- **Display**: internal resolution above or below the console's, 21:9, 32:9 and 48:9 (races show more at the sides), AMD FSR 1 scaling, HDR on HDR
  screens, VSync, mailbox or immediate presentation.
- **Frame generation**: frames made between the game's (a race at 30 fps shown at 60, or at 240 on a 240 Hz screen).
  Smoother, not faster: the picture is up to one frame later, and fast motion and the minimap can smear.
- **Graphics**: texture filtering and quality, detail distance and shadow quality above or below the console's.
- **Sound**: 5.1 surround.
- **Controls**: every key and button rebindable, mouse camera, Nintendo, Xbox or PlayStation button icons, motion
  steering, vibration strength; local multiplayer with one controller each.
  Switch 2 controllers (Pro Controller, Joy-Con, GameCube) work over Bluetooth and, on Linux, over USB; on Windows
  USB needs a one-time driver step, below.
- **Hacks**: turbo (hold or toggle F2), skip movies, unlock everything, the same randomness every time, straight to
  time trial or free roam.
- **Languages**: the menus in 20 languages; the game itself also in Catalan, Galician and Basque.
- **Game files**: choose the installation folder; a dump as folders or as one `.nup` or `.nx` file, used where it is;
  updates from the start screen.
- **Performance overlay** (FPS, or CPU, GPU and memory in full) and a one-click system info for bug reports.

### Switch 2 controllers over USB on Windows

These controllers only start after a command sent to their second USB interface, which Windows leaves without a
driver an app can use. Once per controller, with [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/):

1. Plug the controller in with a USB-C cable and open Zadig.
2. **Options → List All Devices**, then pick the controller's **Interface 1** (USB ID `057E` and `2069` for the Pro
   Controller, `2066`/`2067` for the right/left Joy-Con, `2073` for the GameCube controller). Not Interface 0: that
   one is the controller's normal input, and replacing it hides the controller from every other app.
3. Driver **WinUSB**, then **Replace Driver** (or **Install Driver**).

The same steps apply to a virtual controller that shows up with those USB IDs (Switch2Connect's USB/IP mode). To undo
it, uninstall that interface's device in Device Manager with "delete the driver" ticked.

## Mods

The start screen's **Mods** page installs mods as they are published for the game, and lists them in two tabs:

- **Find on GameBanana**: Mario Kart World's mods on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/22152), listed or
  searched, with each mod's author, license, screenshots and description. **Install** downloads the file from
  GameBanana, only when you ask for it.
- **Installed**: your mods, each with an on/off switch; **Import zip / Import folder** takes a mod you already have
  (`.zip`, `.rar` or `.7z`, with `romfs/` and/or `exefs/` anywhere inside, including the `atmosphere/contents/` layout).

Mods that replace game files (`romfs/`: skins, textures, texts, courses) take effect at the next start. Mods that change
the game's code (`exefs/` `.ips` or `.pchtxt` patches, such as 200cc or 30 FPS) are built into the game code: turning
one on or off rebuilds it before you play (a few minutes). Two mods that change the same archive are merged file by
file, and the page asks which one wins where both change the same file. The page warns about mods that replace the
game's graphics settings or shaders, which the port handles its own way.

Mods are made by other people and are not tested by this project: one can crash the game or damage your save. Read a
mod's page before installing it, keep a copy of your save, and report a mod's problems to its author; when you report
a bug here, say which mods were on (the log lists them), or try again without them first.

## Building from source

Linux, with `uv`, `clang`, `lld`, `ninja`, SDL3, Opus, libvpx, zstd, xxHash, the Vulkan headers and VMA 3.4.0 (details in
[tools/build/README.md](tools/build/README.md)). Put your dump in `game/` (`game/exefs`, `game/romfs`) or set
`MKW_GAME=<dir>`, then from the repo root:

```sh
uv run python recomp/gen.py --exefs game/exefs --out build/generated --jobs 8 --patches recomp/patches-mkw.txt  # 1.8.0: patches-mkw-180.txt
uv run tools/shaders/extract.py && uv run tools/shaders/translate.py
uv run tools/build/build.py              # build/mkw; --target windows builds mkw.exe with llvm-mingw
build/mkw
```

From a packed dump (`.nup`, `.nx`) and for Linux on AArch64: [tools/build/README.md](tools/build/README.md#a-packed-dump)
and [its AArch64 section](tools/build/README.md#linux-aarch64).

Translating the shaders needs the SM86 encoding specification, generated from NVIDIA's `nvdisasm` (not shipped):
see [tools/shaders/README.md](tools/shaders/README.md). Everything generated goes to `build/`, never to git.

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| [recomp/](recomp/README.md) | The generator: AArch64 → C |
| [runtime/](runtime/README.md) | What plays the console: kernel, memory, SDK replacements, NVN2 over Vulkan, audio, input, menus and launcher |
| [sm86/](sm86/README.md) | The shader translator: SM86 SASS → GLSL → SPIR-V |
| [i18n/](i18n/README.md) | The menu, start screen and setup texts in every language (gettext `.po`) |
| [tools/](tools/README.md) | Analysis, setup, build, game runs and diagnostics |
| [tests/](tests/README.md) | Tests without the game or a GPU, in the CI on Linux and Windows |
| [docs/](docs/README.md) | Research, sources and performance |
| `.github/` | CI, issue and pull request templates |

At the root: `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` (the Python environment of the tools), `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (each release's changes, its notes) and `AGENTS.md` (a guide for coding agents).

## Design decisions (30/10/2026)

| Topic | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | AArch64→C lifter based on [totk-pc-recomp](https://github.com/valentderah/totk-pc-recomp)'s (MIT), extended to ARMv8.1-8.3: LSE atomics, CAS, LDAPR; PAC as identity, MTE tags as 0 | Same engine family as MKW, and it already scales to a large executable |
| System | The SDK's `nn::*` functions replaced by name; signatures from the mangled names of `main`'s 1 289 imports | No console services to emulate |
| Graphics | NVN2 over Vulkan: 529 of its 699 functions share their name with NVN1 (signatures known from totk-pc-recomp and nxnative); 170 are new | Recompilation, not GPU emulation |
| Shaders | Our own SM86→SPIR-V translator, offline, with a decoder generated from the DocumentSASS / nvsass-disassembler specification | Covers mesh/task and what Maxwell lacks |
| Optional Switch 2 features | HDR on by itself when the display is in HDR, as on the console (Settings > Screen > HDR: Automatic or Off); DLSS, ray tracing and touch behind options, off by default; off, their NVN2 functions exist but do nothing so the game keeps its normal path | Console hardware extras, not needed to play |
| Defaults | The console's look and resolution; lower settings are options | The player chooses |

## How it was made

This port was written with [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic's coding agent) doing most of the
typing, under my direction, in about ten days of full-time work: 489 commits from 30/10/2026, every one of them
reviewed, measured or tested before it went in. It was not one prompt and done. Behind it:

- **Method more than prompts.** Every change of performance was measured with an A/B inside the same run (two runs
  of the same build differ by up to 12 ms per frame); every rendering fix was checked against the console's own
  image; shader translator changes are tested off the GPU on every one of MKW's 11 561 programs before a game run;
  frame captures replay the back end in seconds without the game. The rules that came out of mistakes are written
  down and enforced by scripts, so the same mistake does not happen twice.
- **What I had learnt before.** The recompiler and the runtime grew out of
  [totk-pc-recomp](https://github.com/valentderah/totk-pc-recomp) and its Linux port, and out of my earlier work on
  other recomps (SavageWindRecomp, smo-recomp): the lifter, the launcher and the setup that builds the game on the
  player's machine, the button icons, the shader control flow. As a maintainer of
  [AnyPS5](https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5) I learnt how to translate GPU shaders faithfully, run mesh shaders
  as compute on GPUs that lack them, and keep a large project honest with checks and measurements.
- **The community's research.** [eden-nx2](https://git.eden-emu.dev/Takoroka/eden-nx2)'s notes on Switch 2, NVIDIA's
  SASS encoding as documented by DocumentSASS and nvsass-disassembler, Ryujinx and Mesa NAK for shader semantics, and
  the other Switch 2 ports listed in the sources.
